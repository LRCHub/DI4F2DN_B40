And if I let you go
I think we'll never know
And then you said to me
"It's really now or never"

And if I let you go
I think we'll never know
And then you said to me
"It's really now or never"

And if I let you go
I think we'll never know
And then you said to me
"It's really now or never"

And if I let you go
I think we'll never know
And the dream away
And then you said to me
"It's really now or never"

And if I let you go
I think we'll never know
And then you said to me
"It's really now or never"

And if I let you go
I think we'll never know
And then you said to me
"It's really now or never"

And if I let you go
I think we'll never know
And the dream away
And then you said to me
"It's really now or never"

And if I let you go
I think we'll never know
And then you said to me
"It's really now or never"

And if I let you go
I think we'll never know
And the dream away
And then you said to me
"It's really now or never"

And if I let you go
I think we'll never know
And then you said to me
"It's really now or never"
