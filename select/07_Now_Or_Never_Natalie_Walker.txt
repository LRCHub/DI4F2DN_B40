I'm on the edge of this bridge
When I jump will I sink or will I swim
I'll take a chance this once
Life's too short to sit and wish

Why have I felt afraid
Doubt has always stared me in the face
No I can't wait anymore
This is mine for the taking

I'm gonna jump in
I'm gonna begin
It's now or it's never
It's now or it's never

I'm not gonna wait
I'm gonna be brave
It's now or it's never
It's now or it's never...

I've clung to what I know
There's so much more that I want to explore
Safe and sound weighs me down
Gotta let it go so I won't drown

I'm gonna jump in
I'm gonna begin
It's now or it's never
It's now or it's never

I'm not gonna wait
I'm gonna be brave
It's now or it's never
It's now or it's never...
