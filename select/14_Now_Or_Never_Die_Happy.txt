I.
I burn passionately for your love
I tremble when I lay in your arms
But it's hard to believe that you'll stay
I will not hold you back
You will always be free
I know that
I don't wait for a chance anymore
I hope you leave before I, I start to ache
Ref:
YOU ARE NOW OR NEVER
YOU COULD STAY FOREVER
BUT I FEEL NOW
THAT I CAN'T GO ON
YOU ARE NOW OR NEVER
YOU COULD STAY FOREVER
I STILL LOVE YOU
BUT I CAN'T GO ON
II.
I burned passionately for your love
I gave you all my warmth, I thought I had enough
But I slowly burn low, disappear
I can't feed the flames alone
It wasn't meant for us both...
To be
The time and the place were wrong
Why do I ache
When I always knew
It isn't a game for me to lose
Not my intention to get confused again
You made it happen and I walk away... overthrouwn
I can't go on
Passionatly
It's all gone
