Got myself a one way ticket
Got a heart that needs some fixing
And I can see the runway lights from here
Touchdown New York City
Skyline looking pretty and
I can feel something in the air

'Cause when I'm with you
I breathe again, I'm free again
I've been waiting
Counting the days yeah
Just to get back to you
Breathe again, I'm free again
Now or never
Maybe forever
When I'm with you

Love and you leave me breathless
You, the one, nobody else does
And I fall deeper into you
So hard to get on top
Your mind never stops yeah
Cause your love is taking over me

'Cause when I'm with you
I breathe again, I'm free again
I've been waiting
Counting the days yeah
Just to get back to you
Breathe again, I'm free again
Now or never
Maybe forever
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

Got myself a one way ticket
Got a heart that needs some fixing
And I can see the runway lights from here

And when I'm with you
I breathe again, I'm free again
I've been waiting
Counting the days yeah
Just to get back to you
Breathe again, I'm free again
Now or never
Maybe forever
'Cause when I'm with you
I breathe again, I'm free again
Now or never
Maybe forever
When I'm with you
